        <h3>Alien (1979)</h3>
            <!--Paragraph-->
            <p>In the distant future, the commercial spaceship "Nostromo" crew is on its way home when the crew picks 
            up a distress call from a distant moon. The crew must investigate, and the spaceship descends on the 
            small planetoid afterwards. After a rough landing, three crew members leave the spaceship to explore 
            the area on the planetoid. At the same time, the ship's computer deciphers the message. When the crew 
            realizes it is not alone on the spaceship, they must deal with the consequences.</p>
        <h3>Ready player one (2018)</h3>
            <p>In the year 2045, the real world is a harsh place. The only time Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) truly feels 
                alive is when he escapes to the OASIS, an immersive virtual universe where most of humanity spends their days. 
                In the OASIS, you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone--the only limits are your own imagination. The OASIS 
                was created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who left his immense fortune and total 
                control of the Oasis to the winner of a three-part contest he designed to find a worthy heir. When Wade conquers 
                the first challenge of the reality-bending treasure hunt, he and his friends--The High Five--are hurled into a 
                fantastical universe of discovery and danger to save the OASIS.</p>
        <h3>La La Land (2016)</h3>
            <p>Aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and jazz musician Sebastian scrapes by 
                playing cocktail-party gigs in dingy bars. But as success mounts, they are faced with decisions that fray 
                the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other 
                threaten to rip them apart.</p>
